## Notes

-   The application runs YouTube Music in a secure webview
-   External links open in your default browser
-   All navigation is handled through the application menu or keyboard shortcuts
-   **Login data is stored locally** in `%APPDATA%\YouTube Music Desktop` for persistence
-   Use "Clear Login Data" from the Navigation menu if you want to log out completely
-   **Audio normalization** uses dynamic range compression to balance volume levels automatically
-   Audio processing may take a moment to initialize when songs start playing
