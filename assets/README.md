# Placeholder Icon File

This is a placeholder for the application icon. To add a proper icon:

1. Replace this file with `icon.png` (256x256 pixels recommended)
2. Add `icon.ico` for Windows builds
3. The icon files should be placed in the `assets` folder

You can create or download icons from:

-   https://iconifier.net/ (convert PNG to ICO)
-   https://favicon.io/ (create simple icons)
-   https://iconsdb.com/ (free icons)

The icon should represent YouTube Music or your custom branding.
